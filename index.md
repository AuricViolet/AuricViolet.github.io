## Welcome Traveler

Before you lies a fork in the road of your Linux pilgrimage - to your left: a well-trodden, bright path to the kingdoms of Arch-based distros. To your right: a dark and foggy forest leading to the mysterious and beautiful land of Nix.

If you're still here, I assume you've already begun to head down the darker path, whether you know it yet or not. The path has a way of drawing people in, you see.

The purpose of this blog is to hopefully serve as a map for seekers and adventurers. To guide you through the treacherous wood and into the chilly mountains of NixOS.

Would you look at that? It's already starting to snow. 

You'd better be on your way.
