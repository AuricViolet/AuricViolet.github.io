Welcome to Violet Nix , a personal github page featuring some recipes and tutorials for NixOS related configurations.

I was motivated to create this page after my own struggles with getting started with NixOS, the documentation is one of the biggest blindspots for Nix and NixOS, and I figured "what better way to contribute to the NixOS ecosystem than to share my own struggles and triumphs." I hope that this page, might help others in the future to learn from my mistakes, or at least avoid some painful troubleshooting.
